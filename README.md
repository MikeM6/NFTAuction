# Sample Hardhat 3 Beta Project (`node:test` and `viem`)

This project showcases a Hardhat 3 Beta project using the native Node.js test runner (`node:test`) and the `viem` library for Ethereum interactions.

## Project Overview

This example project includes:

- A simple Hardhat configuration file.
- Foundry-compatible Solidity unit tests.
- TypeScript integration tests using [`node:test`](nodejs.org/api/test.html), the new Node.js native test runner, and [`viem`](https://viem.sh/).
- Examples demonstrating how to connect to different types of networks, including locally simulating OP mainnet.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

You can also selectively run the Solidity or `node:test` tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test solidity
npx hardhat test nodejs
```

### Make a deployment to Sepolia

This project includes an example Ignition module to deploy the contract. You can deploy this module to a locally simulated chain or to Sepolia.

To run the deployment to a local chain:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

To run the deployment to Sepolia, you need an account with funds to send the transaction. The provided Hardhat configuration includes a Configuration Variable called `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`, which you can use to set the private key of the account you want to use.

You can set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` variable using the `hardhat-keystore` plugin or by setting it as an environment variable.

To set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` config variable using `hardhat-keystore`:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

After setting the variable, you can run the deployment with the Sepolia network:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

## Chainlink USD Conversion (Auction)

The `Auction` contract now supports optional Chainlink Data Feeds to convert bids (ETH or ERC20) into USD for easier comparison.

- Configure feeds once per auction via the seller-only function:

  - `setPriceFeeds(address ethUsdFeed, address tokenUsdFeed)`
    - For ETH auctions (`currency == address(0)`): set `ethUsdFeed` and pass zero for `tokenUsdFeed`.
    - For ERC20 auctions: set `tokenUsdFeed` to the token/USD feed. `ethUsdFeed` is optional.

- Read-only helpers for conversion:
  - `amountInUsd(uint256 amount) returns (uint256 usdAmount, uint8 usdDecimals)`
  - `currentHighestBidInUsd() returns (uint256 usdAmount, uint8 usdDecimals)`

Notes
- `usdDecimals` is the decimals of the associated Chainlink feed (commonly 8). The returned `usdAmount` uses these decimals.
- Make sure you use the correct feed addresses for your network from Chainlinkâ€™s official docs.

## Upgradeable Contracts (UUPS & Transparent)

Upgradeable versions of the Auction and Factory contracts are included:

- UUPS pattern
  - `contracts/upgradeable/AuctionUUPS.sol`
  - `contracts/upgradeable/AuctionFactoryUUPS.sol`
- Transparent pattern
  - `contracts/upgradeable/AuctionTransparent.sol`
  - `contracts/upgradeable/AuctionFactoryTransparent.sol`

Deploy helpers (viem-based):

- UUPS proxies via `ERC1967Proxy`: `scripts/deploy_uups.ts`
- Transparent proxies with `ProxyAdmin`: `scripts/deploy_transparent.ts`

Tips
- Upgradeable contracts use `initialize(...)` instead of constructors.
- UUPS upgrades require `onlyOwner` authorization in `_authorizeUpgrade`.
- Transparent upgrades are controlled by `ProxyAdmin`.
- The original non-upgradeable `Auction.sol` and `AuctionFactory.sol` remain unchanged for existing tests.
